# Mail-Detector

## A tensorflow neural network and its implementation, trained to detect mail trucks in images or video of major US mail carriers. 


This project is a proof-of-concept for a mail truck detection system, consisting of a cross-trained tensorflow neural network, based on MobileNet_V2, and a python inference script which relies on the presence of a video stream (IP camera), designed to detect the presence of the top 3 U.S. mail carriers (USPS, UPS, & Fedex), for use in a notification system (future).
